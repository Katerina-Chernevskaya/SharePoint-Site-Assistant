# SharePoint-Site-Assistant

## Summary

This sample serves to simplify and standardize the site creation process within an organization, offering a tailored experience to users. With a user-friendly interface, the application requires users to respond to seven questions on a Canvas App form, which initiates the creation of a new SharePoint site.

Users have the autonomy to specify the desired site language (English and Lithuanian for now), choose a design from predefined templates, and list external users who they wish to invite as members to the new site. Once these parameters are set and the form is submitted, an automated Power Automate flow is launched, which constructs the site according to the given specifications.

A unique feature of this application is its real-time site name validation system. While filling the form, the entered site name is compared against an existing database to avoid duplication. If a match is found, the system promptly notifies the user, preventing submission until a unique name is provided.

Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Graph API, Responsive Design, and Azure Application Insights, this solution offers a harmonious blend of simplicity and advanced functionality.

If the necessary connections aren't available in your environment, locate the drop-down list adjacent to the required connection and select `New connection`. You will then need to establish a new connection in the tab that opens. After you've created the new connection, return to the solution import dialog tab, click on `Refresh`, and your newly established connection should now be visible in the drop-down list.
Once you are ready, click on the `Next` button.
